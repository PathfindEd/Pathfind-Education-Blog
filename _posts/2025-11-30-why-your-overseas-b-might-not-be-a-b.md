## Introduction: The Hidden Risk to Your Academic Success

When you study abroad, grades are often converted from one country's system to another. A surface "B" can end up being translated differently by admissions offices, leaving you with a lower GPA than you expected.

---

## How grading conversion typically works

- Admissions committees convert incoming grades to their own scale.
- Some systems weight coursework differently (credits vs percentages).
- Rounding and scale differences can shrink a seemingly strong GPA.

> Pro tip: Ask the programs you apply to how they convert grades — some universities publish translation tables.

## Real-world examples

1. Country A: 1–5 scale where 1 = top (so a "B" means something different)
2. Country B: 100-point scale with different grade cutoffs

Use bullet lists and short subheadings — long paragraphs feel heavy. Break content into sections like this.

## Practical steps to protect your GPA

- Request an official grading scale when you order transcripts.
- Provide context in your statement of purpose (brief note).
- Get an evaluation from a credential service where appropriate.

## Conclusion

Small differences in conversion rules can have big consequences. Be proactive — gather official documentation and ask programs how they translate grades.
