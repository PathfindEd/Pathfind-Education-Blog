excerpt: "If you completed your previous degree in English, you may be able to secure a language requirement waiver for your UK university application, saving you time and money."

It is a common scenario: a student who completed their entire undergraduate degree taught in English spends valuable time and money preparing for and sitting the IELTS or TOEFL test, only to find out they never needed to.

Many top universities, particularly those in the UK, offer a waiver for the standard English language proficiency tests if your prior education already proves your competence. This approach saves applicants hundreds of pounds and weeks of effort.

## The Medium of Instruction (MOI) Solution

The key document in securing a test waiver is often the **Medium of Instruction (MOI) letter**.

### What is an MOI Letter?

An MOI letter is an official document issued by your previous university (the one where you completed your degree) that formally confirms:

* The entire curriculum (including lectures, seminars, and course materials) was delivered in **English**.
* All examinations and assessments were conducted and submitted in **English**.

This letter serves as official proof to the admissions committee that you have successfully studied, debated, and written at a university level using the English language.

### Why Universities Accept It

For many UK institutions, a four-year degree completed entirely in English provides a more comprehensive demonstration of proficiency than a single two-hour standardised test score. Accepting the MOI letter reflects a practical approach to assessing international applicants' language ability.

## Avoiding the Unnecessary Test

Every week, ambitious students book tests they could have easily avoided. This mistake costs money and adds unnecessary stress to the application process.

* **Financial Cost:** A single IELTS test can cost over £150, plus the cost of preparation materials.
* **Time Cost:** Preparation and waiting for test results can delay the submission of a time-sensitive application.

### Be Proactive: Always Check First

If your degree was taught and examined fully in English, you must **always check the specific university's policy** before booking a test.

While MOI waivers are widely accepted, they are not universal. Some highly competitive programmes or universities have strict institutional policies that require an IELTS or equivalent score regardless of your previous study.

At Pathfind Education, we help students confirm precisely which UK universities and specific courses accept the MOI letter *before* you apply. Why sit another proficiency test if your entire degree already proves your English ability?
