In the rush to secure a university place, students often become targets for bad actors. Bad offer letters are everywhere. Some are outright fakes created by scammers. Others are technically "real" but come from institutions with such poor academic standing that the offer is effectively useless for your long-term career.

Students often accept these because they simply do not know better, only to find out later that the degree is not recognised or the campus does not exist as advertised.

## The Obvious Red Flags

Before you pay any deposit, check the offer letter for these immediate warning signs:

* **Email Source:** Does the email come from a generic domain (like Gmail or Yahoo) instead of the official institutional domain (e.g., .ac.uk or .edu)?
* **Missing Details:** Are signatures missing? Is there no clear Application ID or Student Reference Number?
* **Suspicious Speed:** Did you receive an "unconditional" offer within hours of applying? Real admissions processes take time.
* **Phantom Programmes:** Does the course title on the letter match exactly what is listed on the university's official website?
* **Fee Discrepancies:** Do the fees requested in the letter differ from the public fee structure?
* **Zero Refund Policy:** Credible universities have clear, fair refund policies for deposits. Scams do not.

## The Deeper Risks

Beyond the obvious scams, there are "low quality" traps. These include colleges that have no published faculty list, or institutions that operate under multiple different brand names to hide a history of poor student outcomes and academic disciplinary issues.

If you cannot verify the offer letter independently, you should not proceed.

We partner exclusively with legitimate, accredited universities offering recognised courses. When you work with us, you can be certain that your offer letter is real and your future is secure.
