The Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and the final unconditional offer stage hinge on one massive administrative detail: proving you have the funds required for your tuition and living expenses.

While you may have successfully navigated the academic application, many students make simple errors in preparing their financial documentation that can cause significant, unnecessary delays. Much like the **[IELTS Trap](/the-ielts-trap-why-your-degree-might-be-your-only-english-certificate/)**, this is an area where failing to read the fine print can result in a rejection.

Here is how to navigate the strict requirements for preparing your Proof of Funds for 2025 entry.

## The Two Financial Requirements

To secure your CAS, you must demonstrate liquid funds covering two distinct buckets: your tuition balance and your maintenance (living) costs.

### 1. Tuition Fees
You must show proof that you have either paid, or have the funds ready to pay, the remaining portion of your first year's tuition fees.

* **The Deposit Strategy:** Most UK universities require a **non-refundable deposit** (typically £2,000–£5,000) to secure your unconditional offer. This deposit is usually deducted from your first year's fees.
* **The CAS Statement:** Once you pay the deposit, the university will officially state the remaining tuition fee balance on your CAS documentation. This is the figure you must prove you hold in your bank account.

### 2. Maintenance Funds (Living Expenses)
The UK government sets a standardised figure for living expenses that you must prove you possess. **Note:** As of 2 January 2025, these requirements have increased.

You must show funds for **9 months** of living expenses.

| Location of Study | Monthly Requirement (2025) | Total Required (9 Months) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inside London** | £1,483 | **£13,347** |
| **Outside London** | £1,136 | **£10,224** |

*Figures based on [official GOV.UK Student Visa guidance](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money).*

**Example:**
If you are studying at the University of Manchester (Outside London) and have £15,000 of tuition fees left to pay, you must show:
£15,000 (Tuition) + £10,224 (Maintenance) = **£25,224** total liquid funds.

## Avoiding the Financial Documentation Traps

The funds must be presented in a specific, compliant format. Failure to meet these technical requirements is the number one cause of administrative delays at the offer stage.

### The 28-Day Rule
**Crucially, the funds (tuition balance + maintenance) must be held in the bank account for a single, continuous period of at least 28 days.**

This 28-day period must end no more than **31 days** before the date you submit your visa application.

* **The Clock:** If the money drops below the required total for even one day (e.g., day 27), the entire 28-day clock resets. You cannot simply top up the account and print the statement immediately.
* **The Document:** You must provide a formal bank statement or letter from a regulated financial institution. Screenshots or internet banking printouts alone are often insufficient unless they include the bank's logo, your name, and account number on every page.
* **The Currency:** If the money is not held in Pound Sterling (GBP), the financial institution must provide the exchange rate, or you must use the official exchange rate published by **OANDA** on the day the statement is prepared.

### Acceptable Financial Instruments
Not all money counts. The UK Home Office and universities are strict about "liquid" funds.

* **Accepted:** Personal bank accounts (current or savings), building society accounts.
* **Rejected:** Shares, bonds, credit cards, property deeds, or pension funds (unless the funds have been withdrawn and are sitting as cash).
* **Parental Funds:** You can use funds held by your parents, but you must provide your birth certificate (to prove the relationship) and a signed letter of consent from them. You **cannot** use funds held by an uncle, aunt, or sibling.

## Conclusion: Act Early

Starting this process after your **[Personal Statement](/how-to-write-a-strong-personal-statement-for-uk-universities-building-trust-and-authority/)** is submitted is already too late. You must prepare your funds and documentation months in advance to ensure the 28-day rule is met when the university requests proof.

Always verify the latest figures directly on the **[GOV.UK Student Visa Money page](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money)** before heading to the bank.
