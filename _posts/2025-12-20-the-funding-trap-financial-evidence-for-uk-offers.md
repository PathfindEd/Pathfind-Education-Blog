The Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and the final unconditional offer stage hinge on one massive administrative detail: proving you have the funds required for your tuition and living expenses.

While you may have successfully navigated the academic application, many students make simple errors in preparing their financial documentation that can cause significant, unnecessary delays. Much like the **[IELTS Trap](/the-ielts-trap-why-your-degree-might-be-your-only-english-certificate/)**, this is an area where failing to read the fine print can cost you time and money.

Here is how to navigate the strict requirements for preparing your Proof of Funds, based exclusively on official UK government guidance.

## The Two Pillars of Financial Proof

You must demonstrate you hold enough money to cover two separate, mandatory financial buckets.

### 1. The Course Fee Requirement

Applicants must show they possess sufficient funds to pay for their course for a full academic year (up to nine months).

* **The Key Figure:** The exact course fee amount you must prove will be explicitly detailed on your **Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)** document.
* **The 12-Month Rule:** You are exempt from proving this course fee money if you have already been living in the UK with a valid visa for at least 12 months on the date you submit your visa application.

### 2. The Maintenance Funds Requirement (Living Costs for Student)

The UK Home Office sets a standardised minimum for the money required to support yourself during your studies. This maintenance fund must be proven unless you qualify for an exemption.

The total amount you need depends on your study location:

| Location of Study | Monthly Requirement | Total Required (Up to 9 Months) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inside London** | £1,529 | **£13,761** |
| **Outside London** | £1,171 | **£10,539** |

* *Definition:* For this purpose, "London" includes the City of London and the 32 London boroughs.

## Avoiding the Financial Documentation Traps

The funds must be verifiable and available according to one strict rule, known as the **28-Day Holding Period**.

### The 28-Day Rule

To satisfy the UKVI, the entire required sum (fees + your maintenance + **dependants' maintenance**) must be held in your bank account for a single, continuous period of **at least 28 days in a row.**

* **The Deadline:** The 28-day holding period must conclude within **31 days** of the date you formally submit your visa application.
* **Example:** If your application submission date is January 1st, you must prove the required funds were present continuously for the 28-day period that ended on December 1st (or any day between December 1st and January 1st).
* **Alternative Proof:** If your money comes from a student loan or financial sponsorship, you must provide formal, verifiable evidence from the loan or sponsorship company. If the loan does not cover your partner or child, you must prove you have money to support them separately.

## The Cost of Bringing Family (Dependants)

Bringing your partner and/or children involves additional financial requirements and specific eligibility criteria.

### Eligibility

You may only bring dependants if you are one of the following:

1.  A government-sponsored student starting a course that lasts longer than 6 months.
2.  A full-time student on a **postgraduate level course (RQF level 7 or above)** that lasts 9 months or longer.
3.  If your postgraduate level course starts on or after 1 January 2024, it must be either a **PhD or other doctorate (RQF level 8)** or a **research-based higher degree**.

A dependant is defined as your husband, wife, civil partner, unmarried partner, or child under 18 years old.

### Dependant Maintenance Funds

Your partner and child must **each** have a certain amount of money available to them. This is **in addition** to the money you must have to support yourself.

| Location of Study | Monthly Requirement (Per Dependant) | Total Required (Up to 9 Months) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inside London** | £845 | **£7,605** |
| **Outside London** | £680 | **£6,120** |

* **Application Timing:** If you apply together as a family, you must prove the total funds for the course fee, your maintenance, and the additional money for each dependant. If they apply separately, they only need to prove the money for their own support.

### Dependant Financial Exemptions

* **Time in the UK:** Your partner or child does not need to prove they have this money if they’ve been in the UK with a valid visa for at least 12 months.
* **Differential Evidence:** If you and your partner/child are from a country listed under the ‘differential evidence requirement’ and are applying at the same time, they do not need to prove they have the money to support themselves.

### Dependant Visa Fees

Each person will need to pay **£524 for the visa** plus the mandatory **healthcare surcharge**.

## Conclusion: Act Early

Starting this process after your **[Personal Statement](/how-to-write-a-strong-personal-statement-for-uk-universities-building-trust-and-authority/)** is submitted is already too late. You must prepare your funds and documentation months in advance to ensure the 28-day rule is met when the university requests proof.

For your administrative safety, always verify the latest figures directly on the **[GOV.UK Student Visa Money page](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money)** before heading to the bank.
