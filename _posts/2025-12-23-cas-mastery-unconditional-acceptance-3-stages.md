The journey from receiving a conditional offer to an **unconditional offer** and the final **Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)** document requires precision and speed. The CAS is the essential unique reference number issued by the university, verifying your place for the Home Office.

This stage is entirely administrative, involving three key steps that must be completed accurately to secure your enrolment.

## Step 1: Meeting All Academic Conditions
An offer is 'conditional' because the university requires you to meet specific academic or administrative requirements. These usually include:

1.  **Final Degree Results:** Providing your final, official degree certificate and academic transcript. This must verify your **[2:1 or equivalent](/why-your-overseas-b-might-not-be-a-b/)** that the university is expecting.
2.  **Language Proof:** Submitting your official IELTS certificate or the required **[Medium of Instruction (MOI) letter](/the-ielts-trap-why-your-degree-might-be-your-only-english-certificate/)**.
3.  **Final References:** Ensuring all your referees have successfully uploaded their Letters of Recommendation (LORs) via the university portal.

You must formally upload verified, scanned copies of all these documents to the university's admissions platform to trigger the move to an unconditional status.

## Step 2: Paying the Acceptance Deposit
The university requires a non-refundable deposit (often £2,000–£5,000) to confirm your commitment to the programme.

* **Financial Compliance:** The payment must be made via an approved, traceable method (bank transfer or official payment portal).
* **The Receipt:** Keep the official receipt/proof of payment. This deposit payment is critical because it will be reflected on your final CAS statement, reducing the amount of funds you need to prove later in the process.

## Step 3: CAS Verification and Issuance
Once you have met all academic conditions and paid the deposit, the university will initiate the CAS process.

The university will review all your documents one final time, including your financial evidence and passport details, to ensure everything is compliant.

* **Check Your Data:** Before the university issues the CAS, they will typically send you a "Draft CAS" for your review. **Check every single detail** (Name spelling, date of birth, passport number, tuition fee paid) against your official documents.
* **The Final Document:** The university then issues the final CAS, which includes your unique reference number.

This reference number confirms that the university has reserved your place and that you have met all necessary requirements for admission. For a full list of documents you may need to prepare for your eventual arrival, refer to the **[GOV.UK Student Visa Documents](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/documents-you-must-provide)** guide.
