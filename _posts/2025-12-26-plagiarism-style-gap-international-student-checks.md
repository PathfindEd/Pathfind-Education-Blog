However, in a Western university environment, these same practices can swiftly lead to failure on a module or even expulsion from the university.

Academic integrity is not a vague, universal concept. It is a highly specific, institutionally enforced set of rules.

## The Cheapest Insurance Policy

The best way to protect your degree is to master referencing before you arrive.

Learning these technical skills early is the cheapest insurance policy for your academic career.
