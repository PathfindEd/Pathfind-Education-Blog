Families often budget beautifully for the first year of university abroad. They secure the initial deposit, calculate the current exchange rates perfectly, and feel confident that the finances are settled.

But what happens in years two, three, and four?

Many students fall victim to the "Compounding Cost Lie." This is the mistaken belief that the cost of your degree in your final year will be the same as it was in your first year. This oversight ignores two major financial factors: tuition inflation and currency risk.

## 1. Tuition Inflation

Universities rarely freeze their fees. International tuition fees often see an inflationary increase of 5% to 8% annually. Over a three or four-year degree, this compound increase can add thousands to the total cost of attendance that was not accounted for in the initial plan.

## 2. Currency Risk

Perhaps the most dangerous variable is the exchange rate. A sustainable study abroad plan cannot be based solely on today's exchange rate.

A sudden 10% depreciation in your home currency effectively means you are paying 10% more for that term's fees, instantly and unexpectedly. If your budget is tight to the penny based on the exchange rate from your first year, a market fluctuation can jeopardise your ability to finish your degree.

## The 15% Buffer Rule

To protect your education, you must calculate funds not just for the programme length at current prices, but with a safety margin.

A robust financial plan requires securing or calculating funds with a **15% buffer applied to years two and beyond**.

Do not budget based on the best-case scenario. Budget based on historical high-risk fluctuation. This ensures that when tuition rises or currencies shift, your education remains secure.
