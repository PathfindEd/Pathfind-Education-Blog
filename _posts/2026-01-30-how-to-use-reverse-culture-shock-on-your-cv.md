## The CV Problem

Most students simply list "Studied abroad for one year" on their CV. While this is a factual statement, it is weak. In a competitive global job market, simply being present in another country does little to differentiate you for a competitive graduate job.

Employers are looking for proof of resilience and adaptability. The best way to demonstrate this is not through your time abroad, but through your return.

## The Advantage of Reverse Culture Shock

The real advantage of studying abroad often manifests as **Reverse Culture Shock**. This is the moment you return home and find your old environment restrictive, dull, or surprisingly different.

While uncomfortable, this psychological shift is proof of maximum adaptability. It shows that you did not just visit a new culture; you integrated into it so deeply that your home culture now feels foreign.

## The Hack: Monetise the Discomfort

Use the discomfort of returning home as your career proof.

Instead of writing a generic bullet point saying "I adapted to a new culture," talk about the analytical process of returning.

**Try framing it like this in an interview:**

"When I returned, I had to analyse how to market my global skill set to a domestic employer. That required me to quickly translate my international experience into quantifiable outcomes that made sense in a local context."

Employers want employees who can transition between cultures and markets seamlessly. By discussing how you handled the reintegration process, you prove you have done it twice.
