excerpt: "When looking for a campus job, don't ask which pays the most. Ask which job offers the highest Networking Score. Prioritise access over income."

If you get a job on the university campus, your first thought will likely be: "Which job pays the most per hour?"

That is the wrong calculation. While immediate income is important, a campus job is also a unique opportunity to build professional bridges.

You should be asking: "Which job has the highest Networking Score?"

## The Value of Proximity

Working in the cafeteria or the student bar offers cash, and often good social interaction with other students. However, working in a specific Faculty's administrative office offers **proximity**.

Proximity means access. It means you are in the same room as professors, research assistants, and departmental decision-makers. It gives you insight into how the department runs and access to information about departmental grants or research opportunities before they are widely advertised.

## Calculate the Return on Relationships

A low-paying job that gets you an introduction to a tenured professor or allows you to demonstrate your work ethic to a Head of Department is a far better long-term investment than a higher-paying job scrubbing dishes.

When selecting your part-time role, prioritise access over immediate income. Calculate the return on relationships, not just the return on minimum wage.
