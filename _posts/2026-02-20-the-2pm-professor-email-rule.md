## The Mistake Most Students Make

Building a relationship with a professor is essential for academic success and future recommendations, but most students approach it incorrectly.

They often send long, overly formal emails late at night, detailing how hard they are working and hoping the professor notices their diligence. Unfortunately, these emails usually just get lost in the backlog the next morning.

## The Secret: Strategic Timing

The secret to getting a response and building rapport is the **2 PM Professor Email Rule**.

Send a brief, high-value email during the mid-afternoon low activity window (around 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM).

### What to Write

Do not ask a basic question about the course material that can be found in the syllabus. Instead, ask a specific question about a piece of their **published research**.

This approach shows genuine interest and intellectual curiosity. It positions you as a student who reads beyond the required list.

### Why It Works

This is strategic timing. The email hits their inbox when they are winding down from the morning rush but before they leave for the day. It positions you as a future collaborator, not just a student asking for a grade check.
